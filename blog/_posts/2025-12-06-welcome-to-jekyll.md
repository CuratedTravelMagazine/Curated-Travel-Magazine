Across the world’s oceans, whales follow ancient migratory paths that shift with the rhythm of the seasons. From the frozen edges of the Arctic to the sunlit coasts of the Pacific, each time of year reveals a new chapter in their journey—a reminder that nature’s cycles continue quietly, beautifully, no matter where we are.
<br><br>
In winter, humpback whales make their way to the warm, protected waters of Hawaii and Mexico to give birth and nurture their young. Spring ushers in playful pods off the coasts of California and Australia, while summer brings majestic gatherings to Alaska’s icy fjords and Iceland’s pristine bays. By autumn, migrations stretch toward the Southern Hemisphere, where whales return once more to calving grounds off the shores of New Zealand and South Africa.
<br><br>
In our November/December issue of Curated, “Whale Watching by the Seasons” takes readers on a global journey that follows these gentle giants through the year. More than a guide to destinations, it’s a meditation on timing—on knowing when to pause, look out to sea, and witness nature at its most awe-inspiring.
<br><br>
We also explore how responsible whale watching can protect marine ecosystems while offering travelers a deeper connection to the ocean. It’s not just about seeing whales—it’s about understanding the world they inhabit, and our role in preserving it.

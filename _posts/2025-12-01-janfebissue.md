<div class="issue-intro">
Jan/Feb Curated is an exploration of movement—across landscapes, cultures, and inner lives. This issue traces journeys shaped by technology and tradition alike, from futuristic modes of travel to deeply human crossings that leave permanent marks. Through immersive storytelling and thoughtful curation, Jan/Feb examines how travel carries us forward while reminding us what cannot be crossed back, asking readers to move not just farther, but more intentionally.

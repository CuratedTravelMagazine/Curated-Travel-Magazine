Debuting in June 2026, the Orient Express Corinthian is set to redefine ultra-luxury cruising. The world’s largest sailing yacht features just 54 spacious suites, five Michelin-starred restaurants led by chef Yannick Alléno, a Guerlain spa, dual pools, a cabaret, and even a recording studio. Every detail is designed for indulgence, comfort, and a travel experience reminiscent of the golden age of exploration — but with a modern, sophisticated twist.

Guests can glide along the French and Italian Rivieras, savoring world-class dining, rejuvenating spa rituals, and immersive onboard entertainment, all while enjoying the intimacy and exclusivity of a small, elegantly appointed vessel. It’s a journey where every sense is engaged, and every moment curated for those seeking the ultimate escape.

This is not just a yacht; it’s a model for sustainable exploration at sea.

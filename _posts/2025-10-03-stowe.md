Autumn in Stowe is a feast for the senses. Fiery maples line quiet country roads, their leaves crackling underfoot, while the crisp mountain air carries the scent of pine and apple orchards. Wander through historic [covered bridges] (https://gostowe.com/things-to-do/covered-bridges) that seem frozen in time, and pause at local [cideries] (https://gostowe.com/things-to-do/cideries) to savor crisp, freshly pressed cider and fall treats. Take in the panorama from the [Gondola Skyride] (https://gostowe.com/things-to-do/gondola-skyride), floating above a sea of amber and crimson, or explore scenic byways and forest trails along the [fall foliage route] (https://gostowe.com/things-to-do/fall-foliage). Every corner of Stowe invites you to slow down, breathe deeply, and experience New England’s quintessential leaf-peeping season in all its vibrant, golden glory.
